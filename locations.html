City of around 1000 lizardmen built atop an ancient "palace" dedicated to Kesh (Malphas). The rather frail strongman (ts'ek xalk, lit. "male strong") Erts'esh, lives at the apex of an ancient ziggurat, and merchants in town have only a 20% chance of finding anything made of metal in the marketplace. The population has a slightly low opinion of humans and will add an upcharge of 5% plus a "tax" of 20 silver - and will insist on actually being paid in <i>silver</i> out of spite.

A lakeside city of 3000 lizardmen, Kruk, the city's strongman - actually a female - is "guided" by her magic-user advisors who are selected by "The Place Where Magic Is Learned", the only magic school known to exist. The city is relatively friendly to humans, even containing a "human quarter" - actually several houses with a fence around them, and several families of lizardmen who have converted to Christianity.
