Any decent role-playing game (RPG) system needs rules for psionics - the use of physical devices, technological or otherwise, to enable or enhance psychic abilities. This holds true not just for science fiction/fantasy games, but those which are grounded in reality but have an eye for the future - a future in which psychic abilities are more highly developed and understood than they are today.<p></p>

MERC is well-suited for the introduction of novel psychic weapons and technologies. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons and other such games, MERC is realistic and does not take "balance" into account when designing equipment and scenarios. This means that the paranormal can be introduced in the game in a realistic fashion, fully matching that which exists in the real world, even if it exceeds or falls short of what can be achieved by conventional means.<p></p>

Below are links to pages containing these rules. Players are advised to print them out and staple them to their MERC rulebooks. If other players or The Company object to the inclusion of these new rules, you must argue with them until they acquiesce.
