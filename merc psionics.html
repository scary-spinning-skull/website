Any decent role-playing game (RPG) system needs rules for psionics - the use of physical devices, technological or otherwise, to enable or enhance psychic abilities. This holds true not just for science fiction/fantasy games, but those which are grounded in reality but have an eye for the future - and, in the future, psychic abilities are certain to be more highly developed and understood than they are today.<p></p>

Some readers may object to this, arguing that so-called "learned men" like James Randi, whose death followed decades of attacks against those who cultivated their psychic abilities, have disproven the entire concept. The truth is, however, that what little we do know shows that it is a potentially potent tool - a notion which the United States government held in the 1970s with the revelations over various programmes to develop remote sensing and psychic possession over an enemy.<p></p>

The Soviet Union had highly advanced programmes for the development of psychic phenomena (referred to as <i>ekstrasensy</i>) for military purposes, as documented in widely read books such as <i>Psychic Discoveries by the Russians</i> and <i>The New Soviet Psychic Discoveries</i>. Public discourse about psychic phenomena in both the United States and modern Russia has been muted in recent decades, but it is likely that any such abilities, if they were developed successfully, would be classified and then field tested in conflict zones which are inaccessible to journalists.<p></p>

In short, MERC is well-suited for the introduction of novel psychic weapons and technologies. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons and other such games, MERC is realistic and does not take "balance" into account when designing equipment and scenarios. This means that the paranormal can be introduced in the game in a realistic fashion, fully matching that which exists in the real world, even if it exceeds or falls short of what can be achieved by conventional means.<p></p>

The rules on this page allow players to determine the psychic potential of characters and how they will be able to unlock that potential. Players are advised to print them out and staple them to their MERC rulebooks. If other players or The Company object to the inclusion of these new rules, the open-minded player must argue with them until they acquiesce.

To determine what, if any, psionic abilities they have, it is important to measure their psychic potential (PSI). This is determined by rolling 2d6 during the character creation process, producing a range of numbers identical to Strength, Agility, and so on. It may be added to the core rulebook as option H on page 6:<p>

MERC characters qualify for different "specialties" depending on what their core stats turn out to be. This is the game's  equivalent to the class system in other role-playing games. There are, however, two important differences. The first is that MERC permits characters to accumulate specialties without penalties, unlike games which permit "multiclassing" but have rules limiting how and when a character may advance within each class. MERC also differs in that there are two tiers of each specialty which gives characters with good but not sufficient stats the ability to participate in specialist work. Those characters with psychic potential may become a Psionicist.<p>

<b>Psionicist:</b> The ability to manipulate and extract information from their environment with the power of their mind. Modifiers are applied to any attempt to use telekinesis, telepathy, pyrokinesis, and clairvoyance.

Psychic powers are used in several skill tests. In <b>Detection</b> (skill test A), characters get a +3 increase if they have Psionicist as a primary skill, and +1 if it is secondary. These modifications only apply to detection of living creatures.<p>
