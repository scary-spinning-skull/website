<p>It occurred to me while driving that I couldn't think of how one might "spray" a room with a machine gun in Mutant Crawl Classics. The adventures don't seem to be written with the expectation that anyone will rush into a chamber and empty a magazine into whoever is assembled there. In fact, of all of the weapons in the core rulebook, there are only two weapons that fire projectiles: the gauzer pistol and the gauzer rifle.</p>

<br>

<p>Gauzer guns are railguns and therefore need power cells in addition to the steel projectiles (<i>not</i> cartridges containing exploside propellants) which are used as ammunition. This is something of a handicap compared to the energy weapons, which only need power cells. Gauzers are also the weakest firearms described in the book, but they come with two advantages over deadlier energy weapons, one of which is "auto firing". Unfortunately, it is not explained in much detail. The MCC core rulebook's entry for the gauzer rifle says:</p>

<br>

<p><div class="passage-quote">"These high velocity projectiles may be fired all at a single target, or set for auto fire, at [up] to 10 multiple adjacent targets in a 90 degree arc."</div></p>

<br>

<p>The entry for the gauzer pistol is similar, except that it doesn't say what the span of the arc is.</p>

<br>

<p>I'm not very good at rules lawyering, but it wouldn't be impossible for me to read this as permitting a character from firing a burst of up to ten projectiles at a single enemy in a single round. There is no set number for the number of rounds fired in a burst, which can allow a player to conserve ammunition as effectively as if he were firing single shots. A Judge could rule that a burst from a gauzer fired a set number of rounds, which would dissuade players from auto firing too often and would be quite a handicap when compared to the game's energy weapons.</p>

<br>

<p>On the other hand, a very lucky player whose character has two action dice and a fully loaded gauzer rifle could potentially hit a target for <i>20d8 damage!</i> Down goes the yvox...</p>

<br>

<p>Also, there are no penalties for firing at multiple targets, so a character with a gauzer rifle or pistol can perform up to 20 normal attacks in a single turn. Worse, a forceful player with a weak-willed Judge might even be able to argue that these rules allow the player to try "magic bullet" trick shots that can hit ten targets with a single round of ammunition!</p>

<br>

<p>There are third party supplements which include rules for less exotic firearms: <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/345673/Leopard-Women-of-Venus-DCC"><i>Leopard Women of Venus</i></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/121302/Crawl-fanzine-no-8"><i>Crawl! #8</i></a>, which are written for DCC, as well as <i><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/488957/ziggurat-of-the-megaton-maiden-an-mcc-rpg-atomic-powered-adventure">Ziggurat of the Megaton-Maiden</a></i> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258799/Meandering--Across-the-Radlands-1"><i>Meandering Across the Radlands</i></a>, which were written for MCC. <i>Leopard Women</i> describes a pulpy science-fantasy setting while <i>Crawl!</i> largely deals with historical and modern firearms, and <i>Meandering</i> is essential for any Judge who wishes to set up a campaign set in a Fallout-type world. The latter two have a mechanic based on gun's rate of fire - a gun with a RoF above 1 may be fired more than once per turn, with each additional pull of the trigger incurring a -1d penalty.</p>

<br>

<p><i>Crawl!</i> firearms additionally includes an "automatic" rate of fire. Automatic guns fire into a 10'x10' area in a single attack with additional rules for crits and saves. These rules do not seem to allow for a very wide "spray and pray" maneuver, but if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo2GFf7exHA">this video</a> is to be believed, some real world machine guns can burn through their ammunition too fast to be sprayed in a wide arc!</p>

<br>

<p><i>Leopard Women</i> does allow for it - a fully loaded "auto-rifle" can burn through its entire clip to shoot everything within a 90 degree arc should they fail a Reflex save. Very cinematic! The auto-rifle's semiautomatic burst, which fires 1d6 bullets rather than 1 in order to gain +1d to hit is vaguely reminiscent of spellburn, although it is far cheaper. Perhaps too cheap; the auto-rifle holds 24 bullets, so a low-level character armed with one could fight with a d24 or even a d30 for an extended period of time. <i>Ziggurat</i> has a robotic enemy with a special attack that is similar:</p>

<br>

<p><div class="passage-quote"><b>Spray the Room</b> - All identified enemies (anyone who attacked <b>CB120s</b> or <b>WB36D</b> [NPC robots with no attacks] and those standing within 10' of them) must make <b>REF</b> save DC 13 or each take 1d8+1 damage from the machine gun arm as it sprays bullets back and forth. This takes its entire round of actions.</div class="passage-quote"></p>

<br>

<p>These attacks are balanced out by the lack of a concomitant boost to damage if a clip is emptied - in other words, only one bullet actually hits. Nevertheless some jamming rules, such as <i>Meandering</i> has, might be called for.

<br>

<p>These are all of the ideas on the subject that I am aware of, but I will always keep my eye open for more. It's just too cool for players <i>not</i> to try!</p>

<br>

<p>By the way, some systems simply do not have rules for such maneuvers. <i>Meandering</i> only allows multiple rounds to be fired at one target, with a -1d penalty for each extra round fired up to -10d. <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/223269/umerican-survival-guide-chase-cover-dcc"><i>The Umerica Survival Guide</i></a> says only that automatic weapons will "will do three dice of damage and expend 10 rounds
of ammo when set to full auto." (<i>USG</i> p. 101). <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/234617/crawl-thulhu-issue-1"><i>Crawl-thulhu #1</i></a> includes a tommy gun in its small arms arsenal, but it does not function any differently from the other firearms in the game. Pity!</p>
