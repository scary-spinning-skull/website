<img src="penguin lessons.gif" class="right-poster" /> I saw part of this movie unwillingly in an AMC "Screen Unseen" feature. A man was sitting in my chair, and he feigned surprise when I told him that I had reserved that exact seat. When the title card came up, I stood up, informed the other patron that he could have my seat, and walked out.</p>

Perhaps the most linear movie ever made. The hero, a talented young BMX rider from a small town, signs up for The Big Race. The organizer of the event intends to use the event to generate positive PR for an up-and-coming star, but the local rider is a better rider and wins. There was some very entertaining stunt riding, but otherwise it was quite dull. When I leaned over to my friend and quietly spoke to him during a trailer, a man directly behind me said "I <i>knew</i> sitting here was a bad idea." He proceeded to bump and kick my seat repeatedly throughout the movie, and, instead of exploding at him, I responded by leaning back as far as I could.

Utterly predictable - a woman with amnesia wakes up in a base where everyone else has been murdered. Shockingly, it turns out that the man who suddenly appears to help her is not real, and she herself is the killer. The best part of the movie are the references to <i>The Thing</i> and <i>Alien</i>, as well as the robotic doctor which asks for a star rating from its patient after performing an operation. A clear example of a "covid movie" where the characters are kept to a minimum and spend as little time in the same room as possible. To top it all off, the movie uses obvious AI-generated animations in some scenes. Also worthy of note is that a couple entered the theater before me and, even though the room was empty, zeroed in on my seat. As with other seat-stealers, they pretended to be surprised that someone was going to sit in the chair that had already been reserved when they bought their tickets.</p>

Glum mafia movie starring Robert De Niro as both the pro- and an-tagonist. Instead of documenting De Niro's ascent to mob-boss-hood, we are told that it has happened by De Niro talking to the camera as if he were in a documentary. The story comes off as a comedy - the good Niro tries to resign from his role after a failed assassination attempt, while his bad character remains convinced that it is a ruse. After it was over, I was stunned to learn that it was only two hours long.
